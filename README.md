# Kavli_UCSC_2019
 The code is used for the project of Kavli summer program in Astrophysics in 2019. 

## What do we want to do?
 In this project, we are exploring the usage of VQ-VAE ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937)) ([2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00446.pdf)) to two ideas:
 - Emulating galaxy images (without noise/psf) to adapt to other surveys using generative models (e.g. PixelCNN)
 - Unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to explore the morphology of galaxies (**has been moved to another repo**)
 
 We modified the [VQ-VAE example](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet/blob/master/sonnet/examples/vqvae_example.ipynb) ([Source code of VQ-VAE](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet/blob/master/sonnet/python/modules/nets/vqvae.py)) from Sonnet library.
 
## Preliminary results
### VQ-VAE code on CANDELS data
 ```
 $python image_to_dict.py
 ```  
  This code is used to generate a dictionary to store images.
  
 ```
 $python vqvae.py
 ```
  I run 100000 epochs on one GPU which takes ~45 mins (~5400 images in training).  
  The data is from CANDELS (GOODS, h band).
  
  (Change **line 155**: Train=False, to use pretrained VQ-VAE model.)

### Add noise/PSF layers
  ```
  $python image_to_dict_noise+psf.py
  ```  
  This code is used to generate a dictionary to store images when you have PSF file. The noise map is generated by Gaussian noise using the mean and variance calculated at 4 corners in each image.

  ```
  $python vqvae_noise+psf.py
  ```  
  I added **noise and PSF layers** in the decoder and run 100000 epochs for this example on one GPU which takes ~ 4hrs (~5400 images in training).
  The data is from CANDELS (GOODS, h band), and the PSF image is from [3DHST](https://3dhst.research.yale.edu/Data.php) (GOODS-S WFC3 PSFs, F160W).

### Connect with Gated PixelCNN
  In this section, I trained [Gated PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05328.pdf) on vector quantized feature map. After implementing VQVAE, we will have two outputs from VQVAE which are the inputs for PixelCNN:
  
  - codebook (e): shape=(K,D), where K is the number of code and D is the dimension of the code.
  - encodings indice: shape=( , latent_size, latent_size, dtype=**int32**), where 'latent_size' means the size of latent map.
  
  I followed the code from [hiwonjoon](https://github.com/hiwonjoon/tf-vqvae) which tried to reproduce the results of the paper - VQ-VAE ([2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00446.pdf)). They applied the code of [Gated PixelCNN](https://github.com/anantzoid/Conditional-PixelCNN-decoder/tree/9a5c9a3df2c58100cf5e3600392e67db8ac7a59e) on the vector quantized feature map extracted from VQ-VAE.
  
  I trained PixelCNN (**unconditional**) 100000 epoches on both CANDELS (84x84) (~7000 images) and sample the prior to generate new feature map. I then use a pre-trained decoder to reconstruct new images from generated feature maps.

## To-do list
 - [x] Adapt the VQ-VAE code to astronomical images (e.g. CANDELS)
 - [x] Add noise/PSF layers before output and retrieve the reconstructed images from the layer before noise/PSF layers
 - [x] Connect with PixelCNN to generate random galaxy images
 - [x] SDSS data
 - [x] Conditional to what labels? --> we condition on T-Type at the moment.
 - [ ] t-SNE to explore the meaning of quantized vector and compare with galaxy properties
 - [ ] Examination
